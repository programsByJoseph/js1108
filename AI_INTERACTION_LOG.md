## Entry: 2025-11-08

- User: Starting now, write all my prompts and your responses to a file named AI_INTERACTION_LOG.md.  You do not need to include our previous chat history up till now

- Assistant: I will append every user prompt and the assistant response to this file from now on. This entry records your request and this acknowledgement. If you'd like me to (a) append automatically after every assistant reply in this session, or (b) also create a helper script to append entries from the command line, say which and I'll add it.

## Entry: 2025-11-08 (continued)

- User: Do not add a helper script

- Assistant: Acknowledged — I will not add a helper script. I will continue appending every user prompt and assistant response to `AI_INTERACTION_LOG.md` automatically as you requested. This entry records your preference.
